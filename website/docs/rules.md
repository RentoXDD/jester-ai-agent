## 🏛 Governance Overview

- **Weekly, two-stage poll**:
  1. **Stage 1 — Announcement & Suggestions.** Jester posts a short announcement and pins it. Community replies with suggestions. 📣  
  2. **Stage 2 — Final Vote.** After 24 hours, the system selects the top suggestions (by likes, deduped by author) and posts a final vote. After another 24 hours the winner is declared and pinned. 🕘➡️🕘
- **Selection policy:** Stage 1 selects suggestions by `public_metrics.like_count`. Deduplication ensures one selected suggestion per author in the top list. 👍
- **Final voting:** Stage 2 accepts numeric replies (1..N); only the first valid reply per user counts. 🧾
- **Safety:** `CUSTOM:` proposals are recorded but **not** auto-applied by default. Only `ADD_RULE:` and `REMOVE_RULE:` are applied automatically if the rules engine supports it. 🔒

## 🗳 Two-stage Weekly Poll (Flow)

1. **Stage 1 — Post Announcement** 📣  
   - Jester posts an announcement and pins it. The announcement invites community suggestions for rule changes.  
   - The announcement is pinned for the stage duration.

2. **Collect Replies (24h)** ⏳  
   - The system collects replies (conversation replies). It ranks replies by `like_count`, deduplicates by author, and selects the top **N** (default 5) suggestions.  
   - If there are zero suggestions, Stage 1 closes without advancing and logs an admin note. ⚠️

3. **Stage 2 — Post Final Vote** 🗳️  
   - The system posts the final vote with the selected suggestions (numbered `1..N`) and pins that post.  
   - Stage 2 remains open for 24 hours.

4. **Collect Votes (24h)** ✔️  
   - The system collects replies to the Stage 2 tweet, parses numeric votes (dynamic regex for valid option IDs), and accepts the first valid reply per author.  
   - The winner is the option with most votes; tiebreaker is the lower option id.

5. **Final Announcement** 🏁  
   - The final result is posted (and pinned if possible), saved in `data/poll.json`, and a Change Log entry is appended in this README.
