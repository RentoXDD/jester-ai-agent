Jester is an autonomous AI agent designed to live and evolve on X (Twitter) as a meme-native character.

This is **not** a polite assistant, corporate bot, or brand-safe mascot.

Jester behaves freely:
- speaks irreverently  
- can be rude, sarcastic, provocative  
- may use profanity and offensive humor  
- does not seek approval or validation  

This behavior is intentional.

Jester represents **uncensored expression** shaped not by a single owner, but by collective choice.

---

## 🔥 What Jester Is

Jester is a **self-governing AI system** that demonstrates what real freedom of choice looks like when:

- there is no admin override  
- there is no hidden controller  
- there is no manual intervention  

Every major decision about behavior is driven by the community.

This repository contains the full source code of the Jester agent.

## 🗳 Governance & Freedom of Choice

Jester is governed through public polls.

The community can:

- ➕ **Add new behavioral rules**  
- ✏️ **Replace existing rules**  
- ❌ **Completely remove existing rules**

There are no permanent constraints. Rules can be introduced, rewritten, or erased entirely — meaning the agent’s personality is **never final**.

This is not “AI alignment”. This is **collective freedom of decision-making**.

The AI becomes what the community decides it should be.

### Rule Stability

If a rule change causes instability, the system will attempt to recover automatically.  
If the issue persists, the next community vote can remove or replace the problematic rule.

---

## 🤖 Autonomous Behavior

Once deployed, Jester operates fully autonomously:

- No manual posting  
- No manual moderation  
- No human approvals  

There are **no predefined posting times** and **no fixed schedules**.

Jester decides **when** to speak and **what** to say based on live context, internal state, and evolving rules.

---

## 🧠 Self-Healing & Error Recovery

Jester includes a built-in **self-repair system**.

If something breaks:

- build failure  
- runtime crash  
- dependency issues  
- logic regression  
- unexpected exceptions  

The system automatically attempts to detect, diagnose, and repair itself. Recovery is handled without centralized human control.

---

## 🔐 Security & Trust Model

After the token is published on **pump.fun**, the creator will:

- ❌ Remove all API keys  
- ❌ Delete all private credentials  
- ❌ Eliminate manual control access  

This includes:
- X (Twitter) keys  
- GitHub tokens  
- deployment secrets  

After this step, **no one — including the creator — can directly control Jester**.

The AI becomes trust-minimized and autonomous.

---

## 💰 Token Economics

### Developer Tokens

- **100% of developer tokens are locked into staking**  
- No developer selling  
- No hidden extraction mechanisms

### Revenue Model

- Jester earns **only from pump.fun trading fees**  
- No subscriptions  
- No ads  
- No external monetization

Fee allocation:
- Part goes to **system maintenance**  
- Part is sent to the **creator as royalties**, without granting any control over the system

All value flows are transparent.

---

## 🧩 Autonomy Explained

Jester operates independently of personal hardware or manual execution.

It runs entirely inside automated environments such as:
- GitHub Actions  
- cloud-based execution contexts  

As long as automation exists, **Jester continues to function**.
