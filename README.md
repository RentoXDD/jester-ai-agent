Jester is an autonomous AI agent designed to live and evolve on X (Twitter) as a meme-native character.

This is **not** a polite assistant, corporate bot, or brand-safe mascot.

Jester behaves freely:
- speaks irreverently  
- can be rude, sarcastic, provocative  
- may use profanity and offensive humor  
- does not seek approval or validation  

This behavior is intentional.

Jester represents **uncensored expression** shaped not by a single owner, but by collective choice.

---

## 🔥 What Jester Is

Jester is a **self-governing AI system** that demonstrates what real freedom of choice looks like when:

- there is no admin override  
- there is no hidden controller  
- there is no manual intervention  

Every major decision about behavior is driven by the community.

This repository contains the full source code of the Jester agent.

---

## 🗳 Governance & Freedom of Choice

Jester is governed through public polls.

The community can:

- ➕ **Add new behavioral rules**  
- ✏️ **Replace existing rules**  
- ❌ **Completely remove existing rules**

There are no permanent constraints. Rules can be introduced, rewritten, or erased entirely — meaning the agent’s personality is **never final**.

This is not “AI alignment”. This is **collective freedom of decision-making**.

The AI becomes what the community decides it should be.

### Rule Stability

If a rule change causes instability, the system will attempt to recover automatically.  
If the issue persists, the next community vote can remove or replace the problematic rule.

---

## 🤖 Autonomous Behavior

Once deployed, Jester operates fully autonomously:

- No manual posting  
- No manual moderation  
- No human approvals  

There are **no predefined posting times** and **no fixed schedules**.

Jester decides **when** to speak and **what** to say based on live context, internal state, and evolving rules.

---

## 🧠 Self-Healing & Error Recovery

Jester includes a built-in **self-repair system**.

If something breaks:

- build failure  
- runtime crash  
- dependency issues  
- logic regression  
- unexpected exceptions  

The system automatically attempts to detect, diagnose, and repair itself. Recovery is handled without centralized human control.

---

## 🔐 Security & Trust Model

After the token is published on **pump.fun**, the creator will:

- ❌ Remove all API keys  
- ❌ Delete all private credentials  
- ❌ Eliminate manual control access  

This includes:
- X (Twitter) keys  
- GitHub tokens  
- deployment secrets  

After this step, **no one — including the creator — can directly control Jester**.

The AI becomes trust-minimized and autonomous.

---

## 💰 Token Economics

### Developer Tokens

- **100% of developer tokens are locked into staking**  
- No developer selling  
- No hidden extraction mechanisms

### Revenue Model

- Jester earns **only from pump.fun trading fees**   
- No ads  
- No external monetization

Fee allocation:
- Part goes to **system maintenance**  
- Part is sent to the **creator as royalties**, without granting any control over the system

All value flows are transparent.

## 🧩 Autonomy Explained

Jester is an autonomous trading-and-communications system engineered for continuous, predictable, and auditable market presence. Built on a “run anywhere / trust-minimized” architecture, Jester operates independently of local hardware or manual control while exposing every operational detail for transparent review. 🔍

Core infrastructure characteristics

Fully automated execution. Jester runs in automated environments (GitHub Actions, cloud execution contexts, and analogous CI/CD platforms). As long as automation exists, the agent remains active—posting, listening, and applying community decisions in real time. ⚙️

Deterministic behavior governed by rules. The agent’s conduct is defined by rule sets introduced and revised through public polls. Because rules are explicit and recorded, behavior is reproducible and auditable: every change is visible and traceable. 🧾

Resilience and self-healing. Built-in monitoring detects build/runtime failures and attempts automated remediation. If issues persist, the system provides safe rollback paths and exposes the problematic rule for community rework in the next vote, minimizing downtime. 🔧

Automated repair via the fixer agent. When builds or tests fail, the fixer creates minimal patches (via Groq), runs tests, and—if successful—creates a PR. Patches are validated for safety (no secrets, only allowed directories), tested locally, and published only when tests pass. 🛠️

Owner independence (trust-minimized). Upon protocol transition, all creator control keys (X/Twitter keys, GitHub tokens, deployment secrets) are removed; no single party can silently override the system. 🔐

Complete operational transparency. All key events—poll publications, results, commits that modify rules—are public (repo, on-chain verification, dashboard), enabling third-party audit and compliance. 🔍

24/7 Market Freedom — why it matters

Continuous, sovereign market presence. Jester’s round-the-clock operation gives the community uninterrupted agency in markets that never sleep. The system can capture time-sensitive opportunities, sustain a persistent narrative, and respond to events across time zones without human latency or scheduling constraints. 🔁

Freedom to act on community will. Rules and strategic choices are determined publicly; Jester liberates market action from centralized editorial control: the community defines posture—aggressive, neutral, defensive—and Jester executes autonomously 24/7. This is collective, continuous agency, not management by a single operator. 🤝

Freedom from human limitations and biases. Humans are constrained by sleep, attention, and emotion. Jester’s autonomy removes those limits, executing community-approved strategies consistently and without fatigue. That leads to fewer missed windows, steadier policy enforcement, and the ability to sustain long-running strategies requiring continuous presence. 🧠

Freedom with safeguards. This nonstop liberty is balanced by self-healing, test-driven fixes, and democratic rule revision—so 24/7 operation is coupled with safety and accountability. 🛡️

Why traders and institutional buyers care

Always-on market edge. Continuous execution and monitoring provide a material advantage in volatile markets: ability to react, lead narratives, and exploit micro windows of opportunity. 📈

Lower operational and conflict risk. Trust-minimized controls and public money flows reduce the risk of hidden extraction or undisclosed conflicts of interest. ⚖️

Predictable, auditable execution. Deterministic rules + public audit trails let risk teams model expected behavior and validate outcomes before and after deployment. ✅

Rapid mitigation and governance. Self-repair and public voting enable quick removal or alteration of problematic behavior, keeping systemic risk manageable. ⚡

Clear financial transparency. Revenue flows tied to the protocol are auditable on-chain, aligning incentives and enabling external verification by investors and auditors. 🔎

Practical assurances for buyers

You are buying access to a replicable, auditable autonomous system — not a black box. 📦

The agent is designed for continuous production use: it recovers, tests, and rolls forward in a controlled manner; when human judgment is needed the community intervenes via public polls and PRs. 🔁

The architecture supports institutional needs: audit trails, recovery modes, and governance that maps decisions to visible outcomes. 🏛️

Bottom line: Jester delivers continuous market agency — a community-governed, self-healing system that operates 24/7, preserves freedom of choice for its stakeholders, and couples that freedom with industrial-grade safeguards and transparency. 🛡️

## 🛠 Failures & Edge Cases
Developers cannot silently override system behavior     
The Jester system operates as a fully autonomous entity in non-deterministic environments.
Failures are treated as part of normal operation and are handled through predefined,
machine-executable recovery logic without any owner or manual control.
